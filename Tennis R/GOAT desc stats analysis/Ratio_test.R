# Author: Sukhwinder Ahluwalia
# Purpose: Analyse tennis data
# How the matches get played â€” ratio of sets won to lost, most common types of sets won/lost minutes played
# The premise is that a great player also wins sets comprehensively. Fewer sets lost, fewer games lost etc.
# Also a shorter match, shorter rallies. Some players are notorious for longer matches so they get penalised here haha
